## Install
`npm install falcinator`

## Usage
Start by importing the component.

`import { Falcinator } from 'falcinator'`

Then, place the `<Falcinator />` tag. Where you put it is mostly irrelevant, as the game takes up the entire screen anyways.

But if you want to have the falcon ship in a specific place, the tag also accepts x and y coordinates.

`<Falcinator x={100} y={500} />`

By default it is placed in the center of the window.
